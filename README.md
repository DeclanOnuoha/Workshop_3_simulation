# Hospital Surgery Suite Simulation – Complete Performance Analysis  
**100% Original • Python 3 • SimPy • Full Statistical Report**


This project analyzes how the number of preparation and recovery rooms affects:
- Patient queue before preparation
- Operating theatre blocking (when no recovery bed is available)
- System performance and statistical precision of estimates
